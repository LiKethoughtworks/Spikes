automated build or jenkins?

latest tag? update it? or use a different tag everytime? how do we now in prod/test server which image to pull?

strategy for docker image versioning?

what if nothing in the dockerfile changes at all, but we just use the same tag?

remote provision?(docker client in jenkins, docker server in aws ec2?)

different configs for different envs, what is the best practice?

which storage driver should we use?

CD practice


==========
my own base image for apt-get and other dependencies
tag in dev, just one, test server stop, pull newer, and run
use swarm, not docker machine
concept overlay, network, coupled with swarm, (consule)
db storage: compose code and data. db挂到ceph，nfs. Or just use RDS
kubernetes networks, you have to do it yourself
ecs, elb, ebs consider those options
diff env, one image, run with different parameter
db credential should not be in image, if the image is public
docker file env, what does it mean?
