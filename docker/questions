automated build or jenkins?
latest tag? update it? or use a different tag everytime? how do we now in prod/test server which image to pull?
strategy for docker image versioning?
what if nothing in the dockerfile changes at all, but we just use the same tag?
remote provision?(docker client in jenkins, docker server in aws ec2?)
